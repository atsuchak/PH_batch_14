/* 
    Fix the Mutation Bug - Discount Preview
    previewDiscount(cart) - should return a NEW array showing what each cart item's price WOULD be after a 10% discount, WITHOUT changing the original cart. The buggy version below accidentally mutates the original objects because objects/ arrays are passed by REFERENCE - writing to item. price inside map() edits the very same object the original cart array points to.

    Input:
        cart = [
            {name: "Pen", price: 100}, 
            {name: "Bag", price: 500}, 
        ]

    Output (new array: original cart price fields unchanged);
        [
            {name: "Pen", price: 90}, 
            {name: "Bag", price: 450}, 
        ]
